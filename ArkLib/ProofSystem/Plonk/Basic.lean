# The Plonk Protocol

We aim to formalize the Plonk protocol (as a polynomial IOP) as stated in the original
Plonk paper [GWZC19].

As we do so, we will break down Plonk into modular components, such as . We also plan to formalize
various extensions of Plonk, such as Maller's optimization trick (which can be seen as a change on
the PIOP level), integration with lookup arguments (i.e. logup), high-degree constraints, and more.
